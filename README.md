# ExpCalc

## Idea
I created ExpCalc to manage my and my flatmates' home budget. "ExpCalc" is short from "ExpensesCalculator".

In application I can enter information about purchased product:

* who bought the product
* when a person bought the product
* what is the price of the product
* who will be using the product

After entering products I can click "Calculate" button and application tells me who owes how much to whom.
